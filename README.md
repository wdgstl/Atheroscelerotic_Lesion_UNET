## Introduction

The pathological cause of deadly heart diseases such as coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke, and peripheral artery disease, atherosclerosis, is a chronic inflammatory disease of the arterial wall that forms fatty plaques. These lesions occur when lipid-containing plaques that build up and line the artery walls cause ruptures, disrupting blood flow and causing adverse cardiovascular events. Atherosclerotic research is commonly conducted using gene engineered mice, such as Apoe and Ldlr knockouts (Apoe-/-, Ldlr-/-). These mice develop all phases of atherosclerotic lesions that humans do, making them a great way to gain more insight into how this deadly pathological cause manifests itself in humans. The method for histological analysis of atherosclerosis consists of the measurement of plaque burden on cross sections of the aortic sinus and root stained with oil red O staining and hematoxylin. 

Because the current methods for measuring atherosclerotic lesion sizes on numerous histological sections are extremely tedious, the goal of this research project is to develop and train a 2D-Unet to automate and optimize this process.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

List any libraries, frameworks, or tools that need to be installed before using your project.

### Installation

Provide step-by-step instructions on how to get a development environment running. Include code blocks for commands that need to be run.
